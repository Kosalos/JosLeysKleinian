Jos Leys Strange Attractor

The panel on the left holds two kinds of controls:
buttons, and one or two dimensional widgets.

Widgets:
Slide your finger up and down the list to select the desired widget.
Its legend will turn Green.

Now on the image, slide your finger to control the widget's parameters.

Note: certain widget rows manage a three part parameter (x,y and z).
    The first graph displays the x,y values, the second graph displays the z value.
    Slide one finger lt/rt/up/dn to control x,y values.
    Slide two fingers to control the companion z value.

Double tap on a widget legend to toggle it between
fast and slow editing.  Red graph background = slow.

Buttons:
A button command is performed by selecting the
legend, then releasing your finger.

Note: Double Tap image to toggle display of control panel.
Note: Swipe control panel up/down to move focus.

A. "Res: Low, High"
   Set resolution of display.
   High res is 4 times more pixels, so slower but much clearer.
B. "Zoom"
   Affect camera distance from object.
C. "Max Steps"
   How often the algorithm attempts to hone in on the object shape.
D. "FinalIter"
   How many 'final iterations' the algorithm performs to finese the object.
E. "BoxIter"
   Number of 'box iterations' the algorithm performs to finese the object.
F. "ShowBalls"
   Toggle whether the distance field spheres are displayed.
G. "DoInversion"
   Toggle whether the object folds itself according to inversion params.
H. "FourGen"
   Toggle whether the Z axis folds along with the X,Y axes.
I. "Clamp_I"
J. "Clamp_DF"
   During final iterations: push the iterated point left or right depending on the sign of KleinI.
K. "box_size_x"
L. "box_size_z"
   Specify folding positions.
M. "KleinR"
N. "KleinI"
   Specify the Real and Imaginary Kleinian parameters.
O. "InvCenterXY"
P. "InvCenterZ"
   Specify the inversion center position when 'DoInversion' is enabled.
Q. "DeltaAngle"
   Control amount of twisting within the object.
R. "InvRadius"
   Set the inversion radius.
S. "DE Scale"
   I added this to control how quickly the algorithm zeros in during
   Distance Estimations to the object.
   Trying to control how many 'dusty pixels' are displayed.
T. "epsilon"
   Controls how close the Distance Estimation algorithm needs to get.
   Smaller values are more accurate, more 'dusty', and slower to determine.
U. "N epsilon"
   Another attempt to control 'dusty pixels'.
   This value determines how far to the left/right/up/down the algorithm
   looks when finding a neighboring hit point to calculate the Normal vector to the current hit position.
V. "Bright"
W. "Shiny"
   Set the diffuse and specular lighting amounts.
X. "LightXY  Z"
   Set the position of the single light source.
Y. "TintXY  Z"
   Colorize the object.
Z. "Save/Load"
   Launch the Save/Load dialog.
1. "Reset"
   Reset to sane default parameters.
2. "Stereo"
   Toggles stereo viewing
   The image is rendered twice, for 'cross-eyed' 3D viewing.
   With the iPad held two feet away, slightly cross your eyes so that there is a third image in the middle.
   Relax your gaze, and concentrate only on that middle image, which is in 3D.
3. "Rotate"
   Sometimes works great, other times throws the object so far
   off-screen that you can't recover. (use Save/Load to start again).
   When 'Rotate' is active:
   The 'Move' widgets drag the object around. (it slowly glides back to it desired location)
   The 'Rotate' widget affects the camera distance from the rotation center.
   Sorry: after quitting Rotate mode, the object is probably hopelessly off-screen.
4. "Morph"
   When toggled 'On' all fields that have their widget set to
   'slow editing style' (Red colored graph background via double tapping the widget)
   automatically slide their value(s) back and forth.
5. "Show Params"
   Just for fun, toggle display of the real-time parameter values.

=================================

"Move"
   Two widgets that are always in the lower left corner.
   The first controls X/Y jogging, while the second controls In/Out movement.

"Rotate"
   Widget always in the lower right corner of the screen controls (sort of)
   rotation of the image.

"Parallax"
   When stereo viewing is enabled, use this to set the stereo effect.
   1. Objects you have decided should appear closer actually do.
   2. How pronounced the stereo effect is.
   Note: this will probalby have to be updated whenever you rotate the view.
